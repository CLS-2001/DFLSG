# Dependability Feature Learning based on Sample Generation for Unsupervised Text-to-Image Person Re-identification
Official PyTorch implementation of the paper DFLSG: Dependability Feature Learning based on Sample Generation for Unsupervised Text-to-Image Person Re-identification. (TCSVT 2025)
## Updates
- (7/30/2025) We will release code of DFLSG. Come soon!!
- (9/10/2025) Code released!

### Requirements
we use single RTX3090 24G GPU for training and evaluation. 

### Prepare Datasets
CUHK-PEDES,
ICFG-PEDES,
RSTPReid,
and UFine6926

## Acknowledgments
The code is based on on [RDE](https://github.com/QinYang79/RDE), [IRRA](https://github.com/anosorae/IRRA) and [MLLM4Text-ReID](https://github.com/WentaoTan/MLLM4Text-ReID).
